# Create a simple list

# Fortunately, with iPython and the Jupyter Notebook we can quickly see all the possible methods using the tab key. The methods for a list are:
#  append
# count
# extend
# insert
# pop
# remove
# reverse
# sort

lst.append(6)
print(lst)

# Check how many times 2 shows up in the list
print(lst.count(2))
